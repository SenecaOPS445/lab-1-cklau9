#!/usr/bin/env python3
'''
    To gain practice, complete your Python script with the following content and details:
        The script should have a Shebang line like you did for your lab1a.py python script
        The script should use a single object called "name"
        The value of the "name" object should be "Isaac"
        The script, when executed, should print out "How old are you Isaac?"
        Sample run:

cd ~/ops445/lab1/
./lab1b.py
 
How old are you Isaac?
'''

name = 'Isaac'

print('How old are you ' + name + '?')

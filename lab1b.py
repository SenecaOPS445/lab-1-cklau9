#!/usr/bin/env python3
'''
To gain practice, complete your Python script with the following content and details:

    The script should have a Shebang line like you did for your lab1a.py python script
    The script should use a single object called "name"
    The value of the "name" object should be "Isaac"
    The script, when executed, should print out "How old are you Isaac?"

'''

# Any line that starts with a "#" is also known as a comment,
# these lines are ignored by the python interpreter even if
# they contain code. The very first line is called a Shebang line, 
# it is used to tell the system which interpreter to 
# use(python2, python3, bash, etc). 

name = 'Isaac'

print('How old are you ' + name +'?')
